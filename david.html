                <h2>The Start</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been playing games since I was a really young age. It all started with the game called
                    Pinball
                    you used to find installed in really old computers along with the very first Minesweeper game. I was
                    always fond of games in general, whether digital or in real life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a point in my life where sports took over, but I eventually went back to video games. It
                    was
                    during high school and after high school where I really got into gaming more because of the game
                    HALO Reach.
                    This was the starting point for my console gaming or gaming in general.

                    <p>
                        When my family moved to Canada, my PC journey began, and my love for video games grew even more.
                        Riot Games' League of Legends fueled this passion, and I became addicted to the game.
                        After earning money from part-time jobs, I built my first PC in 2018 and upgraded it in 2021.
                        The image below is my current PC build, updated earlier this year. I still play League of
                        Legends,
                        and I believe this game will never leave me, along with sports games like NBA. Even when I'm
                        old,
                        I know I'll still be gaming as long as my love for it remains.
