                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I started playing video games when I was about four years old. The
                    first console I played on was the PlayStation Two, released on 2000
                    October 26. I have played on my consoles, including Playstation One,
                    Two, Three, Four, and the Wii. Since 2020, I have moved away from
                    console gaming and now play exclusively on PC. I mostly play single
                    and multiplayer first-person shooter games.

                    <p>
                        DayZ is an open-world survival game that focuses on realism and
                        challenging gameplay. It was originally a mod for a military game
                        called ARMA 2 but later became a standalone game. In DayZ, players
                        are dropped into a fictional city called Chernarus, which zombies
                        have overrun after an apocalypse. The goal in DayZ is simple:
                        survive as long as possible against zombies, environmental dangers,
                        and other players.
