            <h2>The Start</h2>
            <p>
                I have been a playing games since I was a really young age.
                It all started with the game called pinball you used to find installed in really old computers along with the very first minesweeper game.
                I was always fond of games in general where it was digital or in real life.
                But there was point in my life where sports took over, but I eventually went back to video games.
                It was during highschool and after highschool where I really got into gaming more because of the game called HALO Reach.
                This was the starting point for my console gaming or gaming in general.

                    But when my family moved to Canada, this is when my PC journey started and love for video games grew even more.
                    There is this company called Riot Games that made this game called League of Legends and this is where it all started.
                    From here on out, I was addicted to this game and my love of PC and technology grew from there.
                    After earning money from part time jobs, I was able to build my first PC back in 2018 and upgraded it the first time in 2021.
                    The image below is my current PC build which was updated earlier this year. 
                    Until now I am still playing League of Legends. I think this is a game that will never leave me, same with some sports games (NBA).
                    Even when I am really old, I am sure I will still be playing some sort of game as long as my love for this does not die.
